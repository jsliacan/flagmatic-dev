Forked Emil's Flagmatic for experimenting


Flagmatic dev
=============

A package for the Sage system.

To install, type (this will remove other versions of flagmatic and install this one):

    $ cd pkg; cp install-dev-flagmatic /usr/local/bin/; cd; install-dev-flagmatic

Then, from the Sage prompt, type:

    sage: from flagmatic.all import *
