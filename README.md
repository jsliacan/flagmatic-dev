Forked Emil's Flagmatic for experimenting


Flagmatic 2.0
=============

A package for the Sage system.

To install, type:

    $ cd pkg; sage -python setup.py install

Then, from the Sage prompt, type:

    sage: from flagmatic.all import *

If you expect to install flagmatic repeatedly then have a look at the 'install_flagmatic' bash script.
